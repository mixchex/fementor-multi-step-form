## Overview

Creating a responsive, mobile-first, multi-step form in React, Typescript and Styled Components.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

To further develop my skills I decided to try out Styled Components.

I started out with the templated content, and built out the main components, then built out the sections of the form. Almost all components had their own styled developed.

I worked through the responsive layouts to ensure it works well as the viewport changes.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Programming Language
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- How Styled Components worked and understanding how to incorporate them into my workflow.
- Gained further experience working with TypeScript
### Continued development

I am still working through different scenarios with TypeScript to get a better understanding of how it works.
